**RUBRIC**

You will be judged on the "creativity", "usability" and "interactivity" of your flask app. You must:

- use some type of machine learning algorithm
- push the code up to your "public"/personal GitHub accounts
- have a flask front-end that can accept user input
- augment the data with at least one other data source (think web scraping, google maps api, images?)
- use html/css that's prettier than just a couple of white input boxes
- deploy the model to heroku (or similar)
